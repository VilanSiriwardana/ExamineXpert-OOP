As this project folder contains some of the codes of other group members, I'll mention my contribution here.



First Use TeacherLogin.jsp to login as a teacher. Then Continue

1. My contribution 1 - Module Create, View, Update, Delete
	DBConnect.java inside Package com.student
	Package com.module 
			
	modulecreate.jsp
	teachermodulelist.jsp
	teachermodulepage.jsp
	teacherupdatemodule.jsp
NOTE:
*I have modified codes and also added a *validation* to 'mcode' in  'modulecreate.jsp'

3. My contribution 3 - Created the mechanism to calculate marks and display results
	DBConnect.java inside Package com.student

	paperresult.jsp
	CalculateResultServlet - Package com.teacherpaper

This servlet is called just after submitting answers by a student.
Run Index.jsp -> View Student Details -> View Details -> View Module List
Then View First Module ->  View Papers ->  Do a Paper 
Input Answers (Check question table - tanswers)
Submit, then sanswers and tanswers are compared and scored accordingly and grade is determined according to the score
